                    <div class="about-textbox-2-content">
                        <p>As im still in college, I don't have much work experience with working in the tech field. However, I do have some in other areas which I have been able to bring some of the skills I developed while working there. For example, in worked with DT Joinery fitting kitchens and doing other carpentery, plumbing and some electrical work. This work helped me develop valuable teamwork and problem solving skills which I can use in most situations. In the Web Development space, I am currently doing a work placement at BigBite learning how to create websites and later implementing things like frameworks and php into the websites, ultimatelty leading to using these skills in wordpress. </p>
